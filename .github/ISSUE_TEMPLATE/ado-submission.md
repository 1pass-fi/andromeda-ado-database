## Additional Sections/Material Needed 

Make sure you have the following in your PR:

1. Clear and neat ReadMe file that includes a summary of the ADO and documentation on how to use it
2. ADO should contain unit tests (That pass) for all messages in the contract
3. ADO should contain an updated schema file ([Schema generation crate](https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-schema))
