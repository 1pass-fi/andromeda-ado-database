# A repo for users to request new ADOs and Features

## Requesting a New ADO 
To request a new ADO, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/andromedaprotocol/ado-database/issues/new/choose) and use the ADO idea Request template. An example of a good submission can be found [here](https://github.com/andromedaprotocol/ado-database/issues/2). 

Note that this initial idea will not contain all of the necessary technical information that will be required to build out the ADO.
Please note that the Andromeda team will be reviewing and approving these idea submissions at the onset.  Our goal is to work towards a more DAO structured community review and approval.

## Requesting a new feature for an Existing ADO
To request a new feature for an existing ADO, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/andromedaprotocol/ado-database/issues/new/choose) and use the ADO feature template. An example of a good submission can be found [here](https://github.com/andromedaprotocol/ado-database/issues/3).

**Note**
For a submission to be valid, please fill in the templates completely as all the sections are required.
